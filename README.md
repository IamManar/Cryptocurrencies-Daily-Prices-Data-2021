## Disclaimer
- This data not fully cleaned and fully provided by [CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/)
- Low Trade volume Coins aren't converted to USD some of them are BTC pairs and that's because conversion is done automatically when the trade volume of a certain pair is low so the system looks for a pair that has a higher volume and does the conversion which results in different prices.
